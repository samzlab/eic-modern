# EIC Modern Demo

This directory contains the built demo application for GitHub Pages.

The demo is automatically built from the `packages/demo` workspace using:

```bash
npm run build:pages
```

This builds both the core library and the demo, outputting the demo files to this `/docs` directory for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Live Demo

The demo showcases the EIC Modern library functionality with a clean, modern interface for:

- Generating random EIC codes
- Creating custom EIC codes
- Validating existing EIC codes
- Examining EIC code details
